# Join the LangChain Adventure in 2024 and Beyond!

Welcome to my repository, a treasure trove of knowledge and code stemming from my exciting journey with LangChain and large language models. ðŸš€

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a hub for my explorations in the realm of LangChain and the fascinating world of large language models. Here, I compile code, insights, and discoveries drawn from various learning materials, including books, videos, and more.

## Let's Embark on a Journey

Are you ready for an adventure into the future of app development with LangChain in 2024 and beyond? I invite you to join me on this thrilling ride, where we'll unlock the potential of generative AI and large language models.

## Learning Materials

To guide our expedition, we'll rely on two exceptional learning materials:

1. **[Generative AI with LangChain, First Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-ai-with/9781835083468/)**: Dive deep into LangChain and the art of generative AI. We'll explore code, concepts, and practical applications. The author is actively engaged in the Discord group and maintains a responsive [GitHub repo](https://github.com/benman1/generative_ai_with_langchain). Let's learn together!

2. **[LangChain Masterclass - Build 15 OpenAI and LLAMA 2 LLM Apps Using Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/langchain-masterclass/9781835464427/)**: Get ready to build 15 captivating apps using Python, powered by OpenAI and LLAMA 2 LLM. We'll unravel the possibilities and turn ideas into reality. The associated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LangChain-MasterClass---Build-15-OpenAI-and-LLAMA-2-LLM-Apps-using-Python) is our guide to success.

3. **[Building an AI Data Assistant with Streamlit, LangChain and OpenAI | Part 1](https://youtu.be/CBRE_Me1IQ0?si=0ZpYtC6Mvflc1aBM)**: In this video, the first of a series, the presenter embarks on an exciting journey to build an AI-powered assistant, revolutionizing the way data exploration and analysis are approached. This series, titled "Building an AI Assistant to Make Your Data Science Life Easier," showcases the development of an AI assistant using Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. Aimed at assisting with data science projects, this AI assistant promises to simplify and enhance the entire data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model selection and prediction.

Throughout the video, the presenter guides viewers through the process of installing necessary libraries and leveraging AI to tackle a machine learning problem. By the end of this series, viewers are expected to gain a powerful tool to aid them in every aspect of their data science endeavors, saving significant time and resources. This video is an essential watch for anyone looking to streamline their data science projects and work more intuitively with their data. [This site](https://www.digilab.co.uk/posts/build-an-ai-data-assistant-with-streamlit-langchain-and-openai) contains all you need to know about the project including where the dataset was sourced from.
